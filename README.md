======================

I keep here code written during recruitment processes

## cell-war

Objective: Using JS, code app, which simulates two fighting armies.  Introduce randomness into simulation.

## trend-line

Objective: Using Python 2.x, code app which finds trend lines for given time series (currency price)

Used: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib

## stocks-preview

Objective: Using angluarJS & d3, make simple application that shows a chart with stock prices

Details:

1. Create an application that shows a stock chart with stock prices over the past 6 months
2. Give the user an option to select three different stocks to show on the chart.  You should be able to view 1, 2 or 3 at a time
3. Give the user an option to shorten the time period to show on the chart using a slider.  This should adjust all relevant windows (see #5 below)
4. Give the user an option to click on any day in the chart and show the high & low prices for the day, as well as the volume traded
5. Have 3 different windows:
 - A stock price graph over time
 - A grid showing daily high/low prices and volume traded for each stock by day
 - A screen showing company details for the stock the user selects
6. Make the UI look good.

Used: angularJS, d3, nodejs, grunt, bower
